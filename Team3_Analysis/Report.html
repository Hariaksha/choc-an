REQUIREMENTS
- 

Submission instructions:
1. The TeamX_Requirements folder should be compressed. Compress this folder to create a
single ZIP file, also called TeamX_Requirements. The TeamX_Requirements ZIP file should
have only the TeamX_Requirements files. To be sure, open your Zip file and inspect it
before you submit the Zip file.
2. Only one team member (the submitter) shall submit the ZIP file.
3. Submit the ZIP file in Blackboard.
4. You may re-submit as many times as you wish before the deadline. The final submission will
be the graded submission. 

Intro Paragraph Instructions:
Detailed written solution. Include a short paragraph. This paragraph should include the
name of the project, a brief description of the customer company, the names of team
members, the length of project and the programming language for the project. This
paragraph should specify any extra assumptions or your own clarifications if needed. Then
for each task, describe your solution. This paragraph should have explicit references to all
submitted files as well as inline inclusion of images. Failure to produce this paragraph will
result in a penalty of 5% on your total grade. Identify who the submitter is for the
Report.html as well. There is no specified number of words for this paragraph.

For our project, Chocoholics Anonymous, we served a customer company named ChocAn. With a subscription business model, ChocAn helps people break their addiction to chocolate. Our project group comprising of Ethan Busby, Adam Howard, Hariaksha Gunda, Ryan McCulley, Robert Read, Tyler Cruise, and James White spent 32.5 hours completing glossaries, use case diagrams, descriptions, matrices, user stories, and compiling files to create a succinct report on ChocAn's desired software product. The report was written in text documents and then compiled into a webpage using HTML and CSS programming languages.

Our timesheet kept track of work-hours contributed by each group member. This data was kept on a file named Hours.txt, then inputted into an HTML table upon the conclusion of the project. Similarly, our task distribution table was transferred from .txt to .html. This feature divvied our work into managable chunks and allowed each group member to know their exact responsibilities. Group members contributed to the project by 'pushing' their work to an online repository called Bitbucket -- this data can be found in the Bitbucket Statistics portion of our report. Adam Howard published a glossary that highlighted and defined key terms regarding ChocAn's software product. A use case diagram was conceived by Ethan Busby and modified by the group. This diagram visualizes the ChocAn software product functionality. Four actors are included in the schematic: a ChocAn member, provider, operator, and a nonhuman data center. Descriptions of each use case can be found in our attached file named ucdescriptions.pdf. Our story selection matrix was analyzed and completed by Tyler Cruise. Account lifestyle and accessible privacy policy user stories were written by Hariaksha Gunda, giving us a better look into the security details of the ChocAn software product. Finally, this introductory paragraph, as well as the webpage production, was completed by the project submitter, James White.
