First, any new account may always be added to our Data Center; however, one email address can only be linked to one account. Additionally, accounts must be verified upon creation, and users can choose to activate 2-factor authentification. User accounts that miss one monthly payment will be flagged and locked from services of providers. User accounts will be deleted from the Data Center after 3 missed monthly payments to protect user data. Users can also choose to unsubscribe or delete their accounts at any time. Providers also have accounts that they can choose to delete at any time, should they stop collaborating with Chocoholics Anonymous.</ttd>

It also fulfils the other legal requirements for informing the user. Companies often have a standard privacy policy that may be used. The accessibility of privacy policy means that the language of the privacy policy should be simple enough to be understood by the user, and that it is communicated before the user commits to the use of the service, and at any time afterwards at a request of the user. </th>

Both providers and users receive email notifications whenever the Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy is updated. These documents are also always available to view on the company website and app. Lastly, the documents avoid difficult jargon and make the policies easy for users and providers to understand.</td>
